# Fatigue_SN_Curve
An S-N curve defines the number of cycles to failure,  N ( S ) , when a material is repeatedly cycled through a given stress range  S. The S-N curve can be used to calculate the damage in a fatigue analysis.

# How to Use: 

    1) Get material Properties (Sut, E, Poisson
    2) check de example 
    3) Run the code

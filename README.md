# Fatigue_SN_Curve
An S-N curve defines the number of cycles to failure,  N ( S ) , when a material is repeatedly cycled through a given stress range  S . OrcaFlex uses the S-N curve to calculate the damage in a fatigue analysis. If needed you can define a number of different S-N curves and use them at different arc lengths along a line.
